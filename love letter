    <h2>Hey sweet boy,</h2>
    <p>
      In just two months of being together, weâ€™ve shared parts of ourselves that weâ€™ve never shown to anyone else.
      You know how lonely Iâ€™ve been feeling, living and figuring out my life alone abroad. I have been betrayed many times,
      lost my confidence, and doubted myself for so long.
      Yet I met you â€” an amazing man who never fails to call me beautiful every day, who makes me feel so loved,
      and who supports me through everything, reminding me that I am not alone as I face lifeâ€™s challenges.
    </p>
    <p>
      I want to show you how deeply I appreciate you for always being there for me,
      for showing up even when you have your own problems to deal with, and for reminding me that there are so many things I should be grateful for and proud of.
      In just these two months, Iâ€™ve learned so much about you and from you.
      I want you to know that you have someone who will love you as much as you love me, and who will always reciprocate the effort you give.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am so proud of the person you are and of all the amazing things you do.
      Know that I am forever grateful to have you in my life, and grateful to your parents for raising a respectful, kind, and intelligent man.
      I love you
